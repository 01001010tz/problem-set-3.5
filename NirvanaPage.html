  <h2 class="centered" style="margin-block-start:.33em; margin-block-end: .33em;">My Thoughts</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start:.5em">Of all the bands I've listed on this site, I've listened to Nirvana both for the longest, making it
    one of my favorite bands overall. I started with <i>Nevermind</i>, probably one of their most famous albums because
    of its inclusion of "Smells Like Teen Spirit", arguably their most popular song. However, Kurt Cobain notably
    disliked the song because he felt it had become an overplayed "rock anthem" that distracted people who claimed to be
    Nirvana fans from other Nirvana songs. Personally, I have to agree with Cobain despite how much I liked the song
    when I first started listening to them. From Teen Spirit I went to <i>Nevermind</i> as a whole, before listening more to
    <i>In Utero</i> and <i>MTV Unplugged</i>. Unfortunately, I always neglected some of their better songs on <i>Bleach</i> and their 1992 live show
    in Reading until recently, which I discovered was a horrendous mistake as soon as I started listening to them more. Though
    I only list studio discographies on this site, I highly recommend you listen to Nirvana's live albums (especially their recordings
    in Reading 1992,MTV Unplugged in New York, and Pine Street Theater, which was included on the Bleach Deluxe Edition).
    Kurt Cobain is criminally underrated as both a vocalist and guitarist, and furthermore Dave Grohl is an incredible drummer
    and musician (go also listen to Foo Fighters if you feel so inclined). Overall an amazing band with some of my favorite music of all time.</p>
