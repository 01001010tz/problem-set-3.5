  <h2 class="centered">My Thoughts</h2>
  <p>I didn't appreciate Primus until much later, and when I was younger it only
  stood out to me because I thought the strange songs such as "Pudding Time" had
  funny titles or lyrics. The first song I really listened to because I liked the
  sound of it and not the title name was Jerry Was a Racecar Driver. Since my dad
  mostly played from their live album, I didn't hear much of them from the studio,
  but was blown away when we went to actually see them live. We ended up going twice, and
  the first concert was so good it motivated me to listen to more Primus in general.
  Les Claypool is generally an incredible bassist, but seeing him live is something else.
  If you ever get the chance to go, I highly recommend it.</p>
