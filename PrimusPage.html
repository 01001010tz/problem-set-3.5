  <h2 class="centered" style="margin-block-start:.33em; margin-block-end: .33em;">My Thoughts</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start:.5em">I didn't appreciate Primus until much later, and when I was younger it only
  stood out to me because I thought the strange songs such as "Pudding Time" had
  funny titles or lyrics. The first song I really listened to because I liked the
  sound of it and not the title name was Jerry Was a Racecar Driver, though after I continued listening to other songs
  on the same album I quickly realized how much I was missing out on. Unfortunately, I came to later neglect it until we actually
  went to see them live, which completely redefined Primus for me. I had always figured the impossibly fast and distorted bass riffs
  were just the work of the lead guitar or some post-production effects that couldn't really be used to play music practically.
  But when I went to see Primus live, I was blown away by how incredibly talented (and admittedly weird) Les Claypool was. His
  fantastic bass abilities are almost objectively unrivaled, and more or less completely redefined the way I listened to music.
  Before then, I focused mostly on the lead guitar riffs and drum (as both my dad and I drum, making it a lot more focal), seeing
  the bass mostly as a way to either supplement the lead riff or keep time as a more simple drum part would. However, after listening to
  Primus and realizing the true potential bass guitars held musically, I listened for them a lot more prominently in all of the music
  I listened to from then on. Furthermore, Primus further distorts the way I had thought of music in that instead of the guitar
  taking most of the lead, bass supplementing to it, and drums playing off of either of the other two as standard with the music styles I
  was accustomed to, Les and Herb (Primus' drummer) dominate most of the music, while the electric guitar seems to only exist
  for one or two one-off notes played at insignificant parts of the song. And yet it works-- Les and Herb play so well off of each other
  and so well even individually the unorthodox dynamic <i>works</i>, and sounds amazing. Primus' strange but spectacular style was
  so good I've seen them live more than once, and plan on seeing them again whenever possible. If you're ever given the chance,
  I highly recommend it.</p>
